#  ident_header = HTTP header where connection identification is stored.
#                 You probably want set this to 'x-forwarded-for' when
#                 server is behind proxy. Otherwise, leave empty and
#                 source IP will be used
#
#  pow = required POW difficulty
#
#  event_rate_window =
#  event_rate_limit =  defines maximum event creation rate. The window is
#                 in seconds. If you specify window 60, and limit=6, it
#                 allows to create one event every 10 seconds, or 6 burst
#                 events each minute
#
#  whitelisting = prevents entering messages created by unknown authors. To accept
#                 an event, the author must be either followed or mentioned by someone
#                 from this relay. Direct message to a pubkey is considered as mention. 
#                 Direct messages from unknown authors can enter as long as target pubkey
#                 has profile (kind 0) stored at this relay
#                 Users on this relay can also mute a pubkey which is counted as negative point,
#                 which may restult to blacklisting the pubkey. Feature is enabled by default,
#                 unless the relay has empty database, when it can accept any message. So if you
#                 want to 'create account' on this relay, do it immediately after relay is started
#                 for the very first time. This feature can help to prevent spam.
#
#  read_only =    puts realy into read only mode. This disables event creation,
#                 (except empheral events).

#  attachment_max_size_kb = specifies maximum size of attachment
#  attachment_max_count = specifies maximum count of attachments
